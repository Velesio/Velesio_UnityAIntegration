# 📦 Veles Unity Integration

**Veles** is a next-generation AI integration framework for Unity developers, built to simplify and supercharge the way games interact with powerful language and diffusion models.

Whether you're building immersive NPCs, intelligent agents, or AI-driven tools, Veles gives you a seamless plug-and-play interface to tap into both local and cloud-hosted AI systems — all from within Unity.

- ⚡ **Drop-in AI functionality** for Unity — no heavy setup required  
- 🧠 Connect to **locally hosted** LLMs and diffusion models (for offline or power users)  
- ☁️ Or use our **cloud API**, hosted on RunPod and optimized for performance  
- 💬 Enable **AI conversations, behaviors, or image generation** directly in your game world  
- 🛠️ Built to be **open, extensible, and developer-friendly**

## 📡 API Access (Coming Soon)

Users will be able to connect to our hosted Veles AI backend, paying only per API call. Ideal for developers who want powerful AI features without the need to manage local models.

## 🧱 Built On the Shoulders of Great Open-Source

Veles would not be possible without the amazing work from the open-source community. Special thanks to:

- 🧠 [**LLM for Unity**](https://github.com/undreamai/LLMUnity) by *Undream AI* (MIT License)  
  A streamlined interface for integrating LLMs into Unity.

- 🎨 [**Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration**](https://github.com/dobrado76/Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration) by *Dobrado76* (Apache 2.0)  
  A powerful image-generation pipeline with Stable Diffusion.

Their projects serve as a foundation and inspiration for this unified framework.
